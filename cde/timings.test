The timings module
==================

    >>> from cde import timings
    >>> assert 'handle times' in timings.__doc__

Find the time since it happened
-------------------------------

Some quick functions for clarifying names
    >>> years = lambda x: x * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60
    >>> days = lambda x: x * 24 * 60 * 60
    >>> hours = lambda x: x * 60 * 60
    >>> minutes = lambda x: x * 60
    >>> difference = years(5) + days(77) + hours(13) + minutes(2) + 5

The time_since() method converts a number of seconds to English
    It gives only the two most significant numbers
    >>> assert timings.time_since(timings.now() - difference) == '5 years, 77 days'
